      <p>
        Breadth-first search, Dijkstra and A* are three famous path-planning
        algorithms that run on graphs. They can all be seen as a specialised
        version of a graph search with two different parameters, the queue used
        and the heuristic used.
      </p>
      <p>
        The aim of this project is to explore and visualise how the different
        algorithms explore through the graph depending of the parameters chosen.
      </p>
      <p>The general algorithm works as follow:</p>
      <p>A frontier is initialised as a queue containing the start node.</p>
      <p>
        While the frontier is not empty a node (called “current”) is removed
        from the queue and gets “visited”.<br />
        Each of the neighbours of the visited node gets added to the frontier
        with a cost which is the current cost of getting to the current node
        plus the cost of visiting the neighbour from the current node plus the
        value of an heuristic function applied to the neighbour and the goal
        node.<br />
        The heuristic function is an estimation of the cost of the path from the
        two nodes.
      </p>
      <p>
        A reference of the direction of the visit is stored (usually in a
        cameFrom map) in order to be able to reconstruct the path when the
        algorithm stops.<br />
        If the neighbour is already in the frontier its cost can be changed if
        the new path has a cheaper cost.
      </p>
      <p>
        The algorithm stops when it finds a path to the goal (early exit) or
        when the frontier is empty.
      </p>
      <h2 id="bfs">BFS</h2>
      <p>
        BFS can be implemented by using a First-In-First-Out queue. This kind of
        queue ignores the cost of the links in the path and it expands based on
        the number of hops. Because of this it’s guaranteed to find the shortest
        path in terms of hops, nut not in terms of costs associated with the
        hops.<br />
        The heuristic used can be whatever we want, as it will be ignored by the
        queue.
      </p>
      <p>
        The fifo has been implemented using an array, appending elements to the
        end and removing them from the start.

          Animation of BFS, notice how in a grid the frontier (yellow<br />
          nodes) expand as a square, because a square is the set of the nodes at
          the same “hop-distance”
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <h2 id="dijkstra">Dijkstra</h2>
      <p>
        By passing a PriorityQueue instead of a FIFO to the graph and a
        heuristic function which always returns 0 we get the Dijkstra algorithm.
      </p>
      <p>
        The main difference from the BFS is that Dijkstra takes into account the
        costs, the algorithm can now find the actual shortest path considering
        costs of traveling from node to node.
      </p>
      <p>
        The priority queue has been implemented with an array that get sorted
        after every insertion. While not being the most efficient implementation
        of a priority queue, it was easier to implement and is fast enough for
        this application.

      <h2 id="a">A*</h2>
      <p>
        To obtain the A* algorithm from our generalised graph search we just
        need to pass an actual heuristic function, let’s use the euclidean
        distance between the two nodes as example. By weighting the nodes based
        on “cost to the node” + “estimation of cost from node to goal” we can
        speed up the search by going first into nodes that look promising.

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          Thanks to the heuristic, A* can find the correct path faster than
          Dijkstra or BFS
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <h2 id="non-admissible-heuristics">Non admissible heuristics</h2>
      <p>
        A* is guaranteed to find the shortest path only if the heuristic is
        admissible, which means that it never overestimates the actual path
        length. The euclidean distance cannot overestimate, as the euclidean
        distance <em>is</em> the shortest distance/path between two points.
      </p>
      <p>
        But what if we multiply it by a constant <em>k &gt; 0</em> ? By doing so
        it would overestimate making the heuristic non-admissible.
      </p>

      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          The more we increase the value of <em>k</em> the more the algorithm
          goes towards the goal. This also makes it less accurate, making the
          resulting path not always the shortest.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>
      <p>
        The project was implemented in javascript in order to be more accessible
        on the web. I used react for rendering the UI and react-konva for
        rendering the graph.
      </p>
      <p>
        The pathfinder is implemented as a function that accepts the queue type,
        the heuristic, and returns another function which is the actual
        pathfinder (this concept is known as currying).
      </p>
      <p>
        In this way every time the user changes the settings, a new pathfinder
        function is created with the correct parameters and can be used to
        navigate the graph.
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to show every step of the exploration, the function is a
        javascript generator, meaning that it returns an iterator and not just a
        single value. This allows me to yield the entire state of the algorithm
        at every step, save it into an array and then show a specific state
        based on the value of the slider at the top of the page.
